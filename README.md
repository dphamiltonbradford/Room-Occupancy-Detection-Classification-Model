In this Jupyter notebook I use Python and Machine Learning in Sci Kit Learn to predict room occupancy based on temperature, CO2, humidity, light, and humidity ratio. The model uses Logistic Regression trained on temperature and CO2 to classify occupancy, achieving ~87% accuracy. Includes data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization. I utilized the public dataset available here: https://www.kaggle.com/dataset
